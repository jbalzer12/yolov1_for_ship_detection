Author: This repository contains code files by [Aladdin Persson](https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection) as well as files by Josefina Balzer (see [license](https://github.com/jbalzer12/yolov1_for_ship_detection/blob/main/LICENSE))

This repository is part of the Bachelor thesis by Josefina Balzer titled "Deep Learnig for Object Detection on High Resolution Satellite Imagery".
The idea was to improve YOLOv1 by [Redmon et al. (2016)](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov1/) for small object detection. Escpecially small objects in satellite imagery. This work focuses on ship detection.
